## Reading Value of Fixed Resistors

- Resistors are color coded as they are too small for the value to be written on them.
- There are 4 or 5 bands of color . Value of a Resistor is decoded from these band of colors.

### Reading Value:Step 1

- If your resistor has four color bands ,turn the resistor so that the gold or silver band is on right hand side or the end with more bands should point left.

### Reading Value:Step 2

The first band is now on the left hand side. This represents the first digit .Based on the color make a note of the digit.In this case- 4 band its ‘5’ and for 5 band its ‘2’.

### Reading Value :Step 3

The second band represents the second digit. The colors represent the same numbers as did the first digit .In this case -4 band its’6’ and for 5 band its’3’.

### Reading Value : Step 4

The third band divulges how many zeros to add/divide to the first two numbers –for a 4 band Resistor . In this case – 4 band its ‘4’ zeroes to be added . So value is 560K.

### Reading Value : Step 5

The third band denotes the 3rd digit – for a 5 band Resistor. In this case -5 band its ‘7’ . So the value of the 5 band resistor is 237 Ohms as its multipier digit is ‘0.

### Tolerance

The last band denotes the tolerance . So the value of the 4 band resistor it is +/- 10% while for the 5 band resistor it is +/- 1%.

- Tolerance of a Resistor is also an important property to consider .
- A 100 ohm resistor with a 10 % tolerance can mean its value can be any fixed value between 90 to 110 Ohms.
- A 120 Ohm resistor with a 10 % tolerance can mean its value can be any fixed value between 108 and 132 Ohms.
- So there is some overlap between 100 Ohm and 120 Ohm resistance in terms of its limits.

### Carbon Film Resistors

- Most general purpose ,cheap resistor
- Tolerance of Resistance value is usually +/- 5%
- Power ratings of 1/8 W ,1/4 W and ½ W are usually used
- Con:Tend to be electrically noisy

### Metal Film Resistor

- Used when higher tolerance is needed , ie more value.
- They have about +/- 0.05% tolerance

### Wire Wound Resistors
- A wire wound resistor is made of metal resistance wire, and because of this they can be manufactured to precise values
- Also, high wattage resistors can be made by thick wire material
- Wire wound resistors in a ceramic case are called as ceramic resistors
- Wire wound resistors in a ceramic case are called as ceramic resistors
